## Research Areas

I have broad interest in identifying relationships between sequence, structure, dynamics and function of proteins with biomedical importance. For this purpose, we routinely apply computational tools including homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulations.

I am also interested in developing novel tools and applications for structural bioinformatics research, and in drug repurposing using computational approaches with a focus on MD simulations and molecular docking.
