Welcome to the website of Computational Structural Biology Research Group! We are part of the Computational Systems Biology Research Group at Gebze Technical University, Faculty of Engineering, Department of Bioengineering. 

Our research focuses on application of computational biology methods on structures of proteins with biomedical importance. We are particularly interested in the **Major Histocompatibility Complex**, **ERK5 Kinase**, **Major Facilitator Superfamily**, and **Nuclear Receptors**.
