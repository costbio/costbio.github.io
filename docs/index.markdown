Welcome to the website of Computational Structural Biology Research Group! 

We are part of the <a href="https://www.systemsbiology.info.tr">**Computational Systems Biology Research Group**</a> at <a href="https://www.gtu.edu.tr">Gebze Technical University</a>, <a href="https://www.gtu.edu.tr/kategori/41/3/display.aspx?languageId=1">Faculty of Engineering</a>, <a href="https://www.gtu.edu.tr/kategori/307/3/biyomuhendislik.aspx">Department of Bioengineering</a>. 

Our research focuses on application of computational biology/bioinformatics methods on structures of proteins with biomedical importance. 

We are particularly interested in the **Major Histocompatibility Complex**, **ERK5 Kinase**, **Major Facilitator Superfamily**, and **Nuclear Receptors**. 

We occasionally build **software for scientific research** as well.

Feel free to <a href="mailto:osercinoglu@gtu.edu.tr">contact</a> the Principal Investigator Dr. Onur Serçinoğlu if you're interested in collaborating with us.
