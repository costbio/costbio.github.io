Welcome to the website of Computational Structural Biology Research Group, led by **Dr. Onur Serçinoğlu**.

We are part of the Computational Systems Biology Research Group at Gebze Technical University, Faculty of Engineering, Department of Bioengineering. 

Our research focuses on application of computational biology methods on structures of proteins with biomedical importance. 

We are particularly interested in the **Major Histocompatibility Complex**, **ERK5 Kinase**, **Major Facilitator Superfamily**, and **Nuclear Receptors**. 

We routinely apply methods such as **protein structure modeling**, **molecular docking simulations**, and **molecular dynamics simulations** in our research.

Additionally, we are also interested in building **software for scientific research**.

Feel free to **contact** Dr. Serçinoğlu if you're interested in learning more about our research.
